# Games

I wanna model games in a way that you can do a bunch of stuff with them.

* Play them!
* Evaluate them.
* Train AIs to play them.
** Different ways of doing this to find different strategies and stuff would be great.

This I think would be a very metaprogramming heavy project. I'd have
a way to model a game and then lots of code that can operate on
many different games.
I like using both python and rust for this. Python for some of
the modeling and then rust for some of the hardcore search and
evaluation stuff, that could maybe work...

# Experiments

There's a lot of different things to try before this is real.

* Modeling some simple games.
* Generating game playing UI from them.
* Searching and solving games.
* Just general rust + python things
    * Sharing data, how does it work?
